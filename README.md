# Web Engineer // Retail // London // React/Node // Up to £75,000

We're working with a major high-street retailer, who in all honesty, don't have the greatest digital offering compared to other well-known ecommerce sites. But they're trying to change that! They're working on a full-scale replatforming, moving away from legacy into a more juicy, modern stack. That's why they're looking for a handful of strong developers to join the team.

These roles are to help up-skill, mentor and of course deliver their brand new digital offering. They're looking for really strong React, Redux and Node experience as they expand, add features across the main platform and come to compete with other companies within the retail/ecommerce sector.  The team are starting to bring in testing experience now, so someone who can bring any from of testing expertise is highly sought after too.

Large portions of the role include not only replatforming the website, but also being quite brand aware and making their customer and digital experience stand-out - anyone with a key eye for UX and design would be a great addition to the team too.

They're based in Shoreditch, in a brand new office.

What Skills do you need?
The predominant skills needed for this role are about previous experience and knowledge in helping scale start-ups, ecommerce, marketplace platforms or ticketing based systems.

As part of this, having an understanding of how to expand technology teams, and support across tech, dev ops and new products will be necessary.
